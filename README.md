### Shnala React Portfolio

## Description
This portfolio represents a compendium of everything I've learned during my time in coding bootcamp thus far, hosting links to all of my favorite projects. I used Bootstrap to establish the main layout and make it responsive, and React for page navigation. I've had a lot of issues with CSS while working on this project, even on the third go-around of reworking it, and thus this final submission for my class has made it clear to me that I should revisit basic CSS once I've graduated so I can round out my skillset. There are a few bugs in the responsiveness of the layout here, but I will be creating a new portfolio from scratch once class is over for one of my first post-graduation projects; so take everything you see here with a grain of salt! There are much greater things to come in the future. In any case, I enjoyed implementing React and working with it, and very much value the experience that I've gained from it. It is especially important to me that I gain a good hold over React, seeing as it is highly relevant in the current meta of the industry. If nothing else, this last submission has given me a very clear roadmap of where I should put my focus once I graduate.
